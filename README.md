# alvidaa

Two projects in one repo, one weekend, one TV:

1. **A launcher** — a self-installed, self-hosted home screen for Hisense
   **VIDAA** TVs: a clock, your HDMI inputs with live signal, your real
   apps. Nothing sponsored. The TV installs the page itself as a native
   app through its own hidden APIs.
2. **Root** — and more importantly: the first publicly documented root
   path for 2024+ VIDAA firmware (as far as public record shows). A
   browser-exposed file bridge, a sandbox escape found by reading an
   errno, a production boot hook, and a key-only SSH shell — no hardware,
   no flashed partitions, verified boot still green.

Everything runs on a TV you own, through the TV's own APIs, and every
step is designed to be undone. Built with — and designed for — AI coding
sessions: point your agent at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the prompt ladder
that worked is in [docs/HACK-YOUR-OWN.md](docs/HACK-YOUR-OWN.md).

## The two lanes

```
LANE 1 — the launcher (no root needed)

┌─────────────┐   WebSocket    ┌──────────────────┐   MQTT/TLS 36669   ┌─────────┐
│ TV browser  │ ◄────────────► │ server (Pi)      │ ◄────────────────► │ VIDAA   │
│ canvas page │  JSON pushes   │ config + watcher │  RemoteNow control │ TV      │
└─────────────┘                └──────────────────┘                    └─────────┘

LANE 2 — the root chain (see docs/ROOT.md)

cert-gated MQTT ─► browser file bridge ─► ../ escape ─► unauth local API
    ─► rc.local boot hook ─► root at every boot ─► key-only SSH
```

Lane 1 has been tested on the model below; compatibility with other models
and firmware remains to be established. Lane 2 is **model-specific** (SoC and
partition layout bite there) and is documented
stage by stage in [docs/ROOT.md](docs/ROOT.md).

## Quickstart — the launcher

```sh
# 1. the 2024 client cert (the full story: docs/findings/01-mqtt-bridge.md)
#    unzip res/raw/client_mobile_android.p12 from the VIDAA Smart TV APK, then
openssl pkcs12 -legacy -in client_mobile_android.p12 \
  -passin pass:186e990688070325a1c4b0ce275d2388 \
  -clcerts -nokeys -out server/keys/vidaa_cert.pem
openssl pkcs12 -legacy -in client_mobile_android.p12 \
  -passin pass:186e990688070325a1c4b0ce275d2388 \
  -nocerts -nodes -out server/keys/vidaa_key.pem

# 2. pair (TV shows a 4-digit code; type it when asked)
cd server && python3 -m venv venv && ./venv/bin/pip install paho-mqtt
TV_MAC=<tv-wifi-mac> ./venv/bin/python pair.py <tv-ip>

# 3. serve
./venv/bin/python vidaa_server.py <tv-ip> 8765

# 4. on the TV: browser -> http://<server-ip>:8765/ -> "+ INSTALL AS APP"
#    -> OK -> restart TV -> open "Home"
```

Harden `server/config.json` (hide preset apps, rename tiles, set `"autoSwitch": true` to auto-jump to a single active HDMI input on boot, or toggle the watcher) — it is read live. The launcher renders at 1080p (`?540p` fallback), caches tiles in `localStorage` for instant cold paint, auto-focuses active HDMI signals, and binds remote keys `1`–`9` as tile hotkeys. Production deployment on an always-on box:
[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md). Roadmap for shimming and modifying the native stock launcher (`/APPS/channelA/hisenseUI/`) directly on rooted TVs: [docs/LAUNCHER_V2.md](docs/LAUNCHER_V2.md). One server per TV — the paired MQTT identity is exclusive.

## Quickstart — root

Read [docs/ROOT.md](docs/ROOT.md) end to end first, and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the disclosure stance. The short version:
the same browser bridge that installs the launcher can be walked past its
sandbox (`../`), the raw file API behind it is unauthenticated, and a
production boot script executes a writable file as root — after that it's
a static dropbear and five lockpick hook versions. The recon probe
([launcher/recon.html](launcher/recon.html)) includes write probes and a root
hook installation action; inspect it before use. Installing the hook changes
your TV's boot behavior.

reference only — this is an independent implementation).

No system partitions were written during this research; verified boot stayed
locked and green. Changes were designed to be reversible, but a complete
teardown has not been verified: it also requires restoring any edited UI files
and removing the root hook and its associated tools and configuration. The certificates and tokens in
`server/keys/` are device credentials — never commit them. Disclosure
status and reasoning: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
