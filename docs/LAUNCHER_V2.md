# alvidaa v2 — launcher replacement on rooted VIDAA

Status: planning (root landed Oct 2026 — see FINDINGS.md §10 for the recon
story; §10.12 for the toolbox inventory). This document is the launcher-side
plan and the design for moving alvidaa from a Pi-hosted web app to a native
boot-time home. Ownership: this document and everything under `launcher/` +
`server/` belongs to the launcher lane; the firmware/telemetry digging
(binaries, Ghidra, endpoint mapping) lives in the other session.

## Where v1.3 stands (the baseline v2 builds on)

- Server: Python (`server/vidaa_server.py`) on the Pi (`alvidaa.service`,
  port 8770) — MQTT/TLS bridge to RemoteNow (token auth + auto-refresh),
  HTTP static + WebSocket + `/icon/*` proxy, config-driven allowlist/renames/
  glyphs/`autoSwitch`, event-driven + 3s poll home watcher, and guards against
  transient empty `applist`/`sourcelist` payloads during boot churn.
- TV side (`launcher/index.html`, v1.3):
  - **1080p HiDPI canvas**: renders at `1920×1080` (`SCALE = 2` over logical `960×540` layout coordinates, with `?540p` fallback for older sets).
  - **0ms cold-paint cache (`localStorage`)**: renders cached inputs, apps, and shortcuts on frame 1 before `/ws` connects, showing `cached · reconnecting…` if the server is restarting.
  - **Smart initial focus & optional auto-switch**: automatically focuses the first HDMI input with `signal: true` (or the last-launched tile from `localStorage`). When `"autoSwitch": true` in `server/config.json` (or `?autosource` in the URL) and a single HDMI input has active signal on cold boot, starts a 3.5s countdown toast (`Switching to <Input> in 3s… (press any key to stay)`).
  - **Remote number hotkeys (`1`–`9`)**: pressing `1`–`9` on the remote focuses and activates that tile in the active row; `0` / `Home` resets focus to `row 0, col 0`.
  - **Idle GPU throttling**: only redraws the canvas when the clock minute changes, a toast expires, or focus/state changes (1 redraw/min idle instead of 60/min).
- Known limitations v2 (native modification) kills: ~1s stock-home flash before the watcher
  relaunches; Pi dependency when not running the server on-TV; stock home UI still
  loading in the background Cobalt process.

## v1 operational lessons the v2 port must honor

These cost us real debugging time; the on-TV port inherits them as requirements:

1. **Wildcard MQTT subscriptions are denied** (SUBACK Unspecified error) —
   subscribe to exact topics only.
2. **Client identity is part of the credential** — client_id is baked into
   `his$…` auth and topic paths; two processes sharing a client_id kick each
   other off the broker. One session per TV.
3. **applist/sourcelist are JSON arrays**, state/token are objects — don't
   filter payloads by shape or you drop half the traffic.
4. **Token lifecycle**: access token 2 days, refresh token 30 days, refresh via
   `platform_service/data/gettoken` with `{"refreshtoken": …}`. Refresh must be
   re-entrant (mid-run expiry recovery) — a 2-day-old process will hit it.
5. **PIN dialogs rotate on re-trigger** — never poll `vidaa_app_connect`.
6. **Reboot/`pm`-state churn empties applist transiently** — treat an empty
   applist as "keep the previous one", never overwrite cache with `[]`.
7. **The browser D-pad is a pointer** — tiles are click hit-tested; keyboard
   events are secondary.
8. **Web-app browser on a modest GPU** (Chromium 111 "odin" on this firmware;
   older VIDAA sets run Chrome 77): one canvas at 960×540, no offscreen canvases
   (they render empty), no layered DOM/CSS, ES2018-compatible syntax, `Cache-Control:
   no-store` on everything.
9. **app TTL 60s**: TV-side installs/uninstalls must surface within a minute.

## R-phases

### R0 — hook v4: guardrails before anything else (other session + this doc)

1. **OTA freeze at the kernel layer**: iptables rules (hook-owned) dropping the
   firmware-update endpoints. Exact endpoints TBD from the binaries/firmware
   dump — candidate list goes to FINDINGS §10 when mapped. An update that
   reseals the root hole mid-project is the only unrecoverable setback.
2. **2323 lockdown**: `telnetd -l /bin/sh` is an unauthenticated root shell on
   the LAN. The hook adds `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2323 ! -s
   <trusted-ips> -j DROP` before starting the listener; longer term, stage a
   static dropbear and use key auth instead of telnet entirely.
3. **Kill-switch**: if `/var/local/otaTest.off` exists, hook exits 0 untouched.
   Gives us a one-write disable for every future iteration.
4. **Idempotency + lineage**: every hook revision is versioned, keeps the
   previous as `.bak` (pattern set by `otaTest.v1.bak`), and is verified by
   readback before the reboot that activates it.

### R1 — shell persistence (in flight)

Plug pull → hook v3 fires → static busybox lands → `telnet <tv> 2323` as root.
Immediately after: `reboot` binary test (remote reboots from here on), then the
partition dump (`dd if=/dev/mmcblk0pN | tar/nc → Pi`) for the Ghidra lane.

### R2 — map the home plumbing (needs R1)

Questions the map must answer before any patching:

- What does boot actually launch into the home? (§10.7 boot map +
  `/APPS/channelA` UI tree; `preset.txt` vs `Appinfo.json` vs the kilby
  service that assembles the home.)
- Where is the HOME key handled (which process consumes the remote's HOME and
  what does it start)?
- What is rw vs ro under `/APPS/`, `/usr/local/varlocal/`, `/var/local/`?
- `phoenix` runtime: node version, bundled modules (mqtt? ws? fs write paths),
  how its apps/services are registered and restarted.
- Where the stock home's ad/sponsored components render from
  (`/APPS/channelA` rw — candidate for R6 strip).

Deliverable: a map section in FINDINGS (other session's file — coordinate)
plus a written "writable, read-only, do-not-touch" inventory.

### R3 — telemetry + ads at the kernel/service layer

- iptables rules (hook-owned, persistent) for every endpoint the mapping
  surfaces. Log-first for a few days (`iptables -j LOG`) to see what actually
  phones home, then block everything that isn't the opkg/app_upgrade channel.
- Service-level suppression of `hi_logreport_service`, `mdharvester`,
  `write_stat`, `bizm` — stop + disable autostart in whatever service config
  is rw (kilby configs / init scripts). Network blocks without process
  suppression are half a win.
- AdGuard Home per-client rules (LAN layer) stay as defense-in-depth; with the
  kernel layer in place they become redundancy, not the only line.

### R4 — alvidaa on the TV (the port)

Run the bridge + page server on the TV itself under the `phoenix` Node
runtime; the Pi retires to a fallback.

Port inventory (what `server/vidaa_server.py` does today → Node equivalents):

| Python piece | Node port |
|---|---|
| paho-mqtt TLS client, client cert, dynamic/token auth, exact-topic subs | `mqtt.js` (verify availability on phoenix; else raw MQTT 3.1.1 over net is feasible — we already speak the protocol) |
| token refresh (`gettoken`) | same flow, timer + on-reject recovery |
| ThreadingHTTPServer static + `no-store` | plain http server, `Cache-Control` headers kept |
| hand-rolled WebSocket (`/ws`), push listeners | `ws` lib if present; hand-rolled again if not (the protocol code is ours already) |
| `/icon/<appId>` proxy with disk cache (`iconcache/`) | same, cache to a rw dir; the TV fetching `img.vidaahub.com` directly is fine too but the proxy keeps one origin |
| home watcher (gettvstate poll → launchapp by content) | unchanged; on-TV it can also react faster (loopback MQTT) |
| config.json (only/hidden/rename/inputs/watcher) | same file, rw location on TV |

Open items for the port: where phoenix apps live and how they're registered
(R2), whether outbound TLS with our client cert works from node on-TV, storage
path for `keys/` (tokens.json, certs) and `iconcache/`, and how the service
survives the boot order (MQTT broker on 36669 comes up later than the boot
listeners — the server must retry, our reconnect logic already does).

### R5 — stock home suppressed at the source

Once R2 answers where boot/home selection lives: point the boot/home slot at
alvidaa (Appinfo/preset patch in rw space), remap HOME at the OS level. The
watcher stays deployed as a fallback but should never fire. Success metric:
power-on and HOME land on alvidaa with zero stock-home flash.

### R6 — strip the ad components from the home UI code

`/APPS/channelA` is rw and loads into the home screen — remove the
sponsored/ad components at the source instead of hiding tiles. Do this only
after R2's map and with a file-level backup on the Pi; this is the most
invasive rw-space edit in the plan.

## Coordination

- Launcher lane (this repo, this session): `launcher/`, `server/`, config,
  this document, the v1 wiki pages.
- Root/firmware lane (other session): FINDINGS.md recon sections, hook
  versions, binaries/Ghidra, endpoint mapping, telemetry inventory.
- Shared: `docs/FINDINGS.md` — recon sections are the other lane's; launcher
  sections (this file, v1 sections) are ours. Don't reformat across lanes.
- Never commit: `server/keys/` (certs, tokens), `server/iconcache/`.

## Immediate next actions

1. (User) Plug pull → hook v3 activates → `telnet <tv-ip> 2323`.
2. (Root lane) 2323 firewall rule + dropbear swap; OTA endpoint freeze.
3. (Launcher lane, now) this document committed; R4 port skeleton prepared
   behind a flag so it can start the moment R2 reports phoenix's runtime shape.

## R2 map — the home boot chain (mapped 2026-10-30, live root)

```
boot → /usr/local/scripts/hisense_stage0.sh
     → /usr/local/bin/tvmain -D &                      (main TV service)
     → /opt/hisenseUI/startgui.sh &                    (THE shim point)
         cd /opt/hisenseUI
         exec ./bin/hisenseUI --remote_debugging_port=9666 \
              --webdriver_port=4445 --url=file:///hisenseUI/index.html
```

- `bin/hisenseUI` is an **embedded Cobalt-based web engine** (its own exe,
  uid UhisUI, PID stays alive for the whole boot session) — the "browser"
  and the home UI are one process.
- `file:///hisenseUI/index.html` is **not** a filesystem path (no /hisenseUI
  at root, no bind mount in the engine's namespace) — the engine maps it to
  the content tree at **`/APPS/channelA/hisenseUI/`** (index.html + static/ +
  shared/ + process.env.json). `/APPS` = `/dev/mmcblk0p41`, ext4 **rw**,
  whole-partition mode 777.
- The stock home is a webpack SPA: `index.html` (493 bytes, 6-line loader) →
  `vendor.dll.js`, `sdk.js`, chunk js, `app.js`. Plain editable web code.
- `--remote_debugging_port=9666` is in the launch line but **not honored**
  (refused on loopback at boot; no listener) — dead end for live DevTools.
- Boot-time persistence of channel edits: normal boots never re-extract the
  channel (deploy.sh fires only on an OTA upgradeversionflag) — but an OTA
  wipes `/APPS/channelA` entirely (`rm -rf` + re-extract). OTA freeze is the
  precondition for everything here (R0).
- Boot-time DAC: `security-dac-partition-apps.sh` chowns channelA to
  `UhisApp:UGhisApp` and chmods 750 each boot — keep edits readable by that
  uid.

### Canary (in place, pending reboot)

`index.html.alvidaa-bak` on the TV + `alvidaa_backups/hisenseUI_index.html`
on the Pi hold the original 493-byte loader. A visible `#alvidaa-canary` chip
(fixed, top-left, crimson) is appended after `</html>`. If it renders on the
home screen after a reboot, the shim path is proven: edits to this file are
what the stock home executes at boot.

### Strategy verdict & Native Launcher Modification Roadmap

We follow a phased hybrid roadmap so every step is reversible (`index.html.alvidaa-bak` on the TV + full `/APPS/channelA/hisenseUI/` backup on the Pi):

1. **Stage 1 — Loader Shim (`R5`, zero stock-UI flash):**
   - `/opt/hisenseUI/startgui.sh` launches Cobalt (`bin/hisenseUI`) pointing at `file:///hisenseUI/index.html`, which resolves to `/APPS/channelA/hisenseUI/index.html` (493 bytes, `ext4 rw`).
   - Once the `#alvidaa-canary` chip is verified on reboot, replace or shim `index.html` so boot and the physical `HOME` key render **alvidaa** directly inside the `hisenseUI` Cobalt process (`uid UhisUI`), eliminating the stock home flash entirely.
2. **Stage 2 — In-Place Stock `hisenseUI` Surgery (`R6`, stripped native launcher):**
   - Because `hisenseUI` also hosts system overlays and native VIDAA lifecycle hooks in `vendor.dll.js` / `sdk.js` / `app.js`, we can alternatively patch `/APPS/channelA/hisenseUI/static/` in place:
     - Stub out ad-slot fetchers (`layout-ui-eu.vidaahub.com`, `recommend-ui.vidaahub.com`) and promo-video autoplayers (`file-dl-test.../promovod/`) in `sdk.js`.
     - Strip sponsored app row injection and forced telemetry beacons (`hi_logreport_service` / `127.0.0.1:1969`) while preserving native HDMI/settings hooks.
     - Keep `security-dac-partition-apps.sh` ownership (`UhisApp:UGhisApp`, `chmod 750`) intact and freeze OTA in `otaTest.sh` (`R0`) so `deploy.sh` never wipes `/APPS/channelA`.
3. **Stage 3 — Self-Contained On-TV Daemon (`R4`, retiring the Pi):**
   - Run the MQTT/WebSocket bridge directly on the TV (`127.0.0.1:8770`) under the bundled `phoenix` Node.js runtime (or a static helper started from `/var/local/otaTest.sh`), reading credentials and `config.json` from `/var/local/alvidaa/`.

## R2b — the native service gateway (2026-10-30, from sdk.js analysis)

The stock home's backend is a **local phoenix service gateway at
`http://localhost:9009`**. Everything the home does — app launches, sources,
settings, ads, EPG, the home screen itself — is HTTP to this gateway. No MQTT
required for an on-TV launcher; the Pi's control role evaporates.

- Client (decoded from sdk.js): GET/POST `http://localhost:9009/{service|faas}/<path>`
  with `args` as URL-encoded JSON (GET params) or JSON body (POST); handle
  paths are namespaced `basic|system|normal/...`. Gateway responds JSON with
  `ret`/`msg` and sends **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`** — any page
  (including our file:// loader) can call it, CORS-free.
- Raw GET currently returns `{"ret":false,"msg":"service register failed"}` —
  the exact request shape (registration/session) is being recovered from
  live traffic; `/var/log/log.txt` (ui-biz log) is the source.
- Service catalog so far (from `me.req("<name>")` in sdk.js): **launcher**
  (`open("launcherHome", {focusArea: "heroBanner"...})` — the HOME key itself!),
  **ads** (`startUpAds`, `heroBanner` — the startup/banner ads), **apc-service**
  (`getAppStartParam`, power-on app restore), **setting**, **live-tv**, **epg**,
  **kids-mode**, **hotel-mode**, **vidaa-plus**, plus cloud endpoints all on
  `*.vidaahub.com` (voice, recommend-ui, ota-tv, odinstore, oauth-auth) —
  the complete R0 iptables/AdGuard target list.
- The home engine injects native globals into pages it loads: `log`,
  `modeljs`, `guijs`, and the `hisense.*` bridge (`hisense.file.write` seen
  in sdk.js) — our index.html runs in the same context and inherits them.
- UI log: `/var/log/log.txt` (ui-biz lines; root-readable).
- UI engine restart (for picking up index.html edits without full reboot):
  TBD — `kill <pidof hisenseUI>` should trigger a supervisor restart; test
  before relying on it.

### Consequence for v2

The launcher page can be fully self-sufficient **on the TV**: UI from
`file:///hisenseUI/index.html` (our file), control via `localhost:9009`
gateway calls, files via the `hisense.file` bridge. The Pi's remaining role
shrinks to nothing for day-to-day operation; the bridge-on-Pi stays only as
a remote-management convenience.

## R2c — the apm config: we ARE the launcher app (2026-10-30, firmware mining)

The firmware artifacts (41 partition images + opensource seed on fx505,
`~/alvidaa-backup/`) settle the modify-vs-replace question at the config level.
`usr-local/etc/apm/application-config-na-sa.ini` defines the launcher app:

```ini
[launcher]
path = /opt/hisenseUI/startgui.sh    ; the shim point we already control
receive_focus = true
key_priority = 25000                 ; HOME key delivery priority
app_type = virtualapp
isKeepAlive = true
restore_time_when_crash = 10         ; the auto-restart we observed
```

The TV's own app framework defines "the launcher" as `startgui.sh` → the
Cobalt engine → `/APPS/channelA/hisenseUI/index.html`. Consequences:

1. **Our index.html is the launcher app's UI by the TV's own config** — HOME
   key focus, keep-alive, and crash-restore all apply to it automatically.
   No binary patching, no service replacement.
2. The HOME key likely arrives as a key event *inside the page* (key_priority
   routing) — the page can listen and treat it as "I'm already home".
3. **R6 ad-strip becomes trivial**: the ads render because the stock
   `app.js`/sdk.js runs. When our loader is in place, that code never
   executes — the `ads` phoenix service is simply never called.
4. The seed tar ("pristine vendor state") was captured post-experiments: it
   contains `channelA/hisenseUI/index.html.alvidaa-bak`. Harmless, but the
   root lane should know its pristine tag includes that leftover.
5. Partition map: p26 tvconfig, p37 usrfs, p38 **optfs** (engine + cobalt),
   p39 varlfs, p40 serialdata, p41 **apps** (channelA). `debugfs` reads them
   without mounting; `LauncherService` (`/usr/local/bin`) is the native
   service behind MQTT launchapp.

Sole remaining blocker for full native replacement: the black-screen bug on
the inlined page. `launcher/probe.html` (staged) reports the engine's
capability matrix (HTML/JS/UTF8/WS/XHR/img/external-script + native globals
`log`/`modeljs`/`guijs`/`hisense`) on the next experiment reboot.

## Write-minimization law (2026-10-30, user directive)

The p42 dump hang (wedged eMMC controller under sustained IO, recovered by
power cycle — see root lane FINDINGS) plus the user's call: **minimal TV
writes from now on, batched, even though the flash tested healthy.** Reads
are free (wear is program/erase); writes are the budget.

Launcher-lane rules that follow:

1. Every TV write is batched: one write + one reboot per experiment window,
   authorized by the user beforehand. No iterate-and-see deploys.
2. Results are collected over the network (probe pages POST to
   `/api/probe` on the bridge; reads are unlimited) — never by extra TV
   writes.
3. Steady-state launcher writes on TV: zero (logs to the bridge, config on
   the Pi, icon cache server-side).

## Canvas hypothesis (black-screen root cause, pending probe)

Pattern across all boots: every page that rendered (canary div, redirect
trampoline, the stock home itself) is **DOM/CSS**; every page that went black
(both inline launcher attempts) is **canvas-based**. The stock home runs
heavy JS with zero canvas, so it's not size or JS capability.

Working hypothesis: this Cobalt build has **2D canvas disabled** (Cobalt is
built per-platform with feature flags). Consequence if confirmed: the native
launcher is a DOM implementation (divs + CSS, like the stock home), not a
canvas painter — a UI rewrite, not a bugfix.

`launcher/probe2.html` (staged, not deployed) tests this in one reboot:
DOM-based self-reporting (never draws), stages for HTML/JS/UTF8/viewport/
canvas-presence/native-globals (log, modeljs, guijs, hisense,
HiUtils_createRequest, Hisense_*)/WS/XHR/img/external-script, every result
mirrored to the bridge. `probe-report` lands on the Pi via `/api/probe`
(ACAO: * now enabled server-side), so the window needs no user reading and
no TV writes for collection.

Restore state after the last experiment: original loader restored
(md5 fe34aa5d…), watcher re-enabled, TV functional — user watching.
