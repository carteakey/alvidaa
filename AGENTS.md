# AGENTS.md — working on alvidaa with an AI session

This repo is routinely driven by AI coding sessions (the whole project was
built that way — see [STORY.md](docs/project/STORY.md)). If you are an agent (or a
human driving one), this file is your briefing.

## What this repo is

Two lanes share one TV:

1. **The launcher** (product lane): a self-installing home screen for Hisense
   VIDAA TVs — one canvas page + a Python/Pi server speaking the TV's
   RemoteNow MQTT channel. Safe, reversible, the 90% use case.
2. **The research** (root lane): how root was gained on 2024+ firmware and
   what it unlocked. Own-TV-only, documented in `docs/models/50A51HUV/09.01O.P0813/findings/`.

## Ground rules (non-negotiable)

- **Only on a TV you own.** LAN-local. No DRM circumvention. Verified boot
  stays green — the hard "never touch" rules (read-only partitions, `/OAD`
  staging, the stock engine shell, the root-exec triggers) are checked in as
  [tools/launcher-host/never-touch.json](tools/launcher-host/never-touch.json),
  and scripts refuse against it via `never-touch.cjs`; every match is a
  refusal, not a warning. Freeze OTA endpoints before editing UI code.
- **Reversibility is the design law.** Every change needs a teardown path.
  The hook keeps a rolling backup (`/var/local/otaTest.v1.bak`); check
  `/var/local` state before overwriting — another agent session may be
  working the same TV. Check `git log` too.
- **One MQTT server per TV.** The paired client identity is shared; two
  servers kick each other off the broker.
- **Keys and tokens never leave `server/keys/`** (gitignored). LAN IPs in
  code are fine.
- **FINDINGS discipline**: every discovery — bug, trap, errno — goes into
  `docs/models/50A51HUV/09.01O.P0813/findings/` the same hour it happens. That discipline is why the
  root chain worked.

## Map

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `server/vidaa_server.py` | HTTP + WebSocket + MQTT bridge; `/api/open` loads any URL on the TV; `/api/recon` receives probe reports |
| `server/pair.py` | the 2024 pairing handshake (cert + dynamic credentials) |
| `server/tv` | root one-shot/interactive wrapper over dropbear (PATH-fixed) |
| `bridge/` | on-TV Go daemon: loopback HTTP + WS + local MQTT session (see `bridge/README.md`) |
| `launcher/recon.html` | the probe page pattern (v1–v8 in git history) |
| `launcher/hookinstall.html`, `hookcheck.html` | remote hook install/verify |
| `docs/models/50A51HUV/09.01O.P0813/findings/01…09,11–12` and `docs/research/10-patched-firmware-playbook.md` | canonical record: bridge, privilege map, root primitive, SSH gauntlet, root summary, images, endpoints, patched firmware playbook, firmware notes, cobalt runtime & overlay traps |
| `docs/launcher/` | launcher deployment, the on-TV launcher v2 roadmap, and the two-lane architecture (LANES.md) |
| `docs/project/` | the project story, AI prompt ladder and blog draft |
| `docs/research/` | cross-model inventory, method catalogue, tested-models guide and playbook |
| `scripts/check.sh` | read-only health check: generated tables vs JSON, python/shell syntax, relative doc links, duplicate firmware rows |
| `scripts/report.py` | tested-model report scaffolder: validates the firmware id, refuses duplicates, scaffolds the guide tree, appends the inventory row, runs the generators + check |
| `scripts/gen-site.py` | renders the markdown in place into `site/` for GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) |
| `TODO.md` | open work, ordered — loose ends and the catalogue refactor plan |
| `firmware/ENDPOINTS.md` | live endpoint/kill-list working copy (gitignored) |

## Canonical recipes

- Verify before you commit: `./scripts/check.sh` — read-only, no regeneration.
  Fails on stale generated tables, syntax errors, or broken relative links.
- Screenshot the TV (no remote interaction): `tools/screenshot.sh [out.png]` —
  vendor HAL capture into TV `/tmp`, pulled over the root-SSH lane. `/dev/fb0`
  has no readback path on this MTK display (read/dd give ENODEV); the HAL's
  sysctrlservice RPC is the working lane.
- Root shell: `./server/tv` (interactive) or `./server/tv 'cmd'`. PATH is
  exported by the wrapper — dropbear sessions have none. Default host is
  `192.168.0.11`; override with `TV_HOST=<ip>` when the TV's DHCP lease moves.
- Load any page on the TV: `curl "http://<server>:8770/api/open?url=…"`.
- MQTT traps: subscribe to **exact topics** (wildcards silently denied);
  list payloads are JSON **arrays**; one session per credential set;
  the firmware disables ICMP — probe TCP 36669, never ping.
- The TV's browser exposes `Hisense_*` bridge functions to any page, and
  the file bridge (phoenix, localhost:9009) is unauthenticated with CORS
  `*`. The TV browser must never see the open web — DNS-block it.

## Onboarding a new TV/model

1. Fingerprint: SSDP descriptor (`transport_protocol=`), then
   `Hisense_GetFirmWareVersion()` / `Hisense_GetChipSetName()` from any page
   in the TV browser.
2. Launcher lane first (generation-dependent, not SoC-dependent): pair,
   serve, self-install. See findings 01.
3. Root lane only after 1–2 are green, and expect SoC-specific differences
   (this chain is MTK9602/armv7; HiSilicon models differ in partitions and
   tools). See findings 03–07 for the method, not just the constants.
4. Add the unit to `docs/research/inventory.json` (single source of truth)
   and run `scripts/gen-inventory.py` — the README compact matrix and the
   full table in `docs/research/TESTED-MODELS.md` both regenerate from it.
   By PR.
